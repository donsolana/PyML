# PyML
Machine Learning in Python. 

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey, hence it contains code from tutorials and scholarship programs I have priveledged to participate in.

All code here are from exercises on Udacity's "Intro to ML with Tensorflow" course unless explicity specified otherwise.

The "Binary Classification" Notebook is my original work.
